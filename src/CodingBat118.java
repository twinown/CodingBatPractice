/*
You have a green lottery ticket, with ints a, b,
        and c on it. If the numbers are all different
        from each other, the result is 0. If all of the
        numbers are the same, the result is 20. If two of
        the numbers are the same, the result is 10.
        greenTicket(1, 2, 3) → 0
        greenTicket(2, 2, 2) → 20
        greenTicket(1, 1, 2) → 10*/
