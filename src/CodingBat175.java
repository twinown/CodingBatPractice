/*For this problem, we'll round an int value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost
        digit is 5 or more, so 15 rounds up to 20. Alternately, round down to the previous
        multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is less than 5, so 12 rounds down to 10. Given
        3 ints, a b c, return the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write
        a separate helper "public int round10(int num) {" and call it 3 times. Write the helper
        entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum().
        roundSum(16, 17, 18) â†’ 60
        roundSum(12, 13, 14) â†’ 30
        roundSum(6, 4, 4) â†’ 10*/
