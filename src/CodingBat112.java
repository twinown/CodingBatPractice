Given three ints, a b c, return true if
        they are in strict increasing order,
        such as 2 5 11, or 5 6 7, but not 6 5 7 or 5 5 7.
        However, with the exception that if "equalOk" is true,
        equality is allowed, such as 5 5 7 or 5 5 5.
        inOrderEqual(2, 5, 11, false) → true
        inOrderEqual(5, 7, 6, false) → false
        inOrderEqual(5, 5, 7, true) → true*/
